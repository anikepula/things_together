This last year after you came into my life has been so eventful, exhilerating and at the same time filled with joy and love I thought I would never experiance.
Getting to see you everytime on a video call or in real life activates all the reward centers in my brain and lights up the muscles on my face involutarily to smile.

You're my wish that came true. You're the first thing I think of every morning after I wake up and last thing I think of everynight before I sleep off.



If I had to do this all over again, I would as many times as I could.
To our time together on earth and beyond. 
Love you shreshkiii <3.
